## üß∞ Installation & Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/samratmajumder/document-redactor-online.git
cd document-redactor-online
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```
./build.sh
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory ready for deployment.

## üåê Deployment

### Nginx Configuration

A sample nginx configuration is provided in `nginx.conf`. To use it:

1. Copy the built files to your web server:
```
cp -r dist/* /var/www/redactor.deeparmada.com/
```

2. Configure Nginx by placing the configuration in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and creating a symlink:
```
sudo cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/redactor.deeparmada.com
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/redactor.deeparmada.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

3. Set up SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt:
```
sudo certbot --nginx -d redactor.deeparmada.com
```

## üîß Customization

### Branding

To customize the branding:

1. Replace the logo and branding in the `Header.jsx` component
2. Update the colors in the theme in `App.jsx`
3. Modify the footer in `Footer.jsx` to include your organization's details

### Features

To add new features:

- Add new redaction tool options in the `RedactionCanvas.jsx` component
- Support additional file formats by extending the handlers in `DocumentRedactor.jsx`
- Implement text detection or other advanced features by modifying the canvas interaction code

## üìù How It Works

1. **Upload**: Users upload a PDF document or image (JPG, PNG). For password-protected PDFs, users will be prompted to enter the password.

2. **Redact**: Users draw rectangles over sensitive information they want to permanently remove using the intuitive canvas interface. The application handles coordinate mapping between display and actual document coordinates.

3. **Download**: When the user clicks "Apply & Download", the application:
   - Creates a copy of the original document
   - Applies permanent black rectangles over the selected areas
   - For PDFs, properly handles the coordinate system differences
   - Optionally removes password protection
   - Returns a securely redacted document that can be safely shared
